# Swolemates

Swolemates was inspired by the numerous comments I heard from others, particularly women, regarding how they wish they could go to the gym and workout, but they feel too intimidated to go alone. 

Swolemates helps users overcome a fear of going to the gym alone - or just those looking to find a workout buddy for more fun and support. Users are able to search for gyms by type of gym such as a rockclimbing gym and by location using the Yelp Fusion API. They can view members who also favorited a gym and save interesting profiles and send messages to these users to plan their next workout session!

Users can either create an account or sign in with their Google Account (using OAuth 2.0 protocol). All passwords are hashed and salted with werkzeug or bcrypt.

The application also uses [Faker library](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to assist in seeding an initial set of imaginary users.
